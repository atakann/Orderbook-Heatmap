This project showcases two different approaches to building a heatmap visualization in a React application: one using D3.js (in `Heatmap` component) and the other using pure React & JavaScript (in `Heatmapfn` component).

## Implementations

### 1. Using D3.js (`Heatmap` Component)

The `Heatmap` component utilizes D3.js.

**Features:**
- Data binding and rendering using D3.js
- Automated scaling and axis generation
- Responsive design suitable for complex visualizations

### 2. Using Pure React & JavaScript (`Heatmapfn` Component)

The `Heatmapfn` component uses only React and JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Manual implementation of data scaling
- SVG rendering within React's JSX
- Direct control over visualization components
